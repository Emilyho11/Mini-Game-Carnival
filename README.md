# Mini Game Carnival
  - Interactive and fun games for kids to have fun and learn!
  
## The games include:
  - An apple-picking game that teaches math
  - A space game that teaches about the planets in our solar system
  - Two guessing games (Player guesses the zoomed-in picture shown on screen):
      1. Animals
      2. Disney
  - A 'flappy bird' game, except the player's avatar is randomized to be anything, not just a bird
  - A maze game, where the player has to collect as many coins along the way
    
  Goal of this project: Learn Pygame and Python, while making a fun game for children to play!
